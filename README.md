This site will grab your coordinates and provide a location name, temperature, and current weather description


About the site


(1) The weather is predicted for a particular geological area.

(2) Over a specified period of time (e.g. 6 hours) several different variables are measured and observed. 

(3) This data needs to be collected from the different sources and stored for later access.

(4) The collected data is analyzed and transformed into a common format (e.g. Fahrenheit to Celsius scale).

(5) Then, a numerical weather forecast is made based on mathematical-physical models (e.g. GFS - Global Forecast System, UKMO - United Kingdom MOdel, GME - global model of Deutscher Wetterdienst).

(6) The results of the numerical models are complemented with a statistical interpretation (e.g. with MOS - Model-Output-Statistics). 

(7) The numerical post-processing is done with DMO (Direct Model Output): the numerical results are interpolated for specific geological locations.

(8) Additionally, a statistical post-processing step removes failures of measuring devices (e.g. using KALMAN filters).

(9) The statistical interpretation and the numerical results are then observed and interpreted by meteorologists based on their subjective experiences.

(10) Finally, the weather forecast is visualized and presented to interested people.
